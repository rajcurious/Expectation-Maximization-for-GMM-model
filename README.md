# Expectation-Maximization-for-GMM-model

Expectation Maximization for Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) is a soft clustering algorithms.
With this algorithm we can cluster the data as a mixture of gaussian distributions.

GMM_EM,contains the algorithm of expectation maximization for Gaussian mixture model

Train_visualization.m shows the training on iris dataset with GMM_EM and visualizing the training process and output.
